## üê≥ Introduction

CrossSync is a socially-oriented web3 Dapp that runs on the Crossbell. CrossSync aims to allow a user-owned flow of social information.

Crossbell allows users the ability to take back their data ownership; CrossSync makes owning your data a fun and engaging social experience.

To get started, you‚Äôll need go to [Crossbell Faucet](https://faucet.crossbell.io) and get some $CSB. After you‚Äôve connected your wallet and received the $CSB, you‚Äôll be able to mint a profile on CrossSync.

## ü™ô Special

You can find us [on Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/6465/crosssync) !

## üéÅ Installation

The latest stable version can be grabbed from [Release Page](https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/CrossSync/releases) with zipped file attached.

You can also migrate to [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crosssync/cilehfhekljoecdbbimgebbncpjagmon) for the published version. It might have some latency than the Release version because Google need to review it before publish.
